## General Information
 Project puropse is to show my vision of future of RPA (Roboti process automation).
 It is simple project written in python with two agents (at the moment; in future there will be more of them).
 First agent is Business Analyst who gather information about task from user and create task details for second agent.
 Second agent is RPA developer with knowledge of python who create the code.
 Then code is presented to user and may be executed.
 
 It works in this version for simple tasks like creating files, combining several files into one, sending emails etc.
 
 It was inspired by my friend, who manually merged hundreds of excel file due to lack of knowledge of programming.
 If he had tool like this he would have done it within 2 minutes.
